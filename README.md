City Bike Data- Analysis 

After reviewing the bike data from the first month and last month collected, interesting relationships were identified. In Sheet 1, the line graph shows that bikers rode for longer periods on average for the entire first month as opposed to the last month collected. There were a few exceptions, but the average was consistent. 

Sheet 2 illustrates a line graph showing that younger bike riders rode for longer periods, with the exception of those born after 1986. There was a steady increase in time spent riding until reaching those born from 1986-1994. Those riders steadily declined in time spent riding. This could be a result of lifestyle change or athleticism at younger ages. 

When the data was first collected in June 2013, the data shows in Sheet 3 that there were more customers than subscribers. This could be due to how early the program was in its development. An investigation of these metrics would be interesting to compare to Aug 2020 data. 

It appears from Sheet 4 that there were only a few riders who achieved almost 4 million seconds in trip duration. In general, riders traveled between 500k and 2500k seconds. This allows for future planning of routes to determine the average distance needed to map these times in order to accommodate the average bike rider.

Overall, the data uncovered that younger riders travel for longer times, there are only a few outliers, when the program began there were more customers than subscribers, and over time bike riders are traveling for less time than in 2013.
